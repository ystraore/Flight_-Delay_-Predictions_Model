        "# Predicting Categories of Flight Delay Among Popular Airlines\n",

        "#### Introduction and Problem Statement:\n",
        "Flight delays are a significant concern in the aviation industry, impacting operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction. This study aims to develop a predictive model to categorize flight delays into three distinct categories: no delay, significant delay, and lengthy delay. These categories are defined based on the duration of the delay, with thresholds determined by the distribution of delay times in historical flight data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The categorization is as follows:\n",
        "- No Delay: Delays of 10 minutes or less, typically considered negligible in terms of impact on passengers' schedules.\n",
        "- Moderate Delay: Delays between 10 to 30 minutes, which can cause inconvenience but are unlikely to severely disrupt travel plans.\n",
        "- Lengthy Delay: Delays exceeding 30 minutes, often resulting in significant disruptions to travel schedules and plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "The classification thresholds are established using the 0.33 and 0.66 quantiles of the delay duration distribution in the dataset, aligning with the practical implications of these delay durations from a traveler's perspective. The objective is to employ machine learning techniques to accurately predict the category of delay for a given flight, thereby aiding airlines and improving passenger experience through better communication and planning.\n",
        "\n",
        "This model could serve as a tool for airlines and passengers, offering insights into potential delays and allowing for more informed decision-making regarding flight schedules and travel plans."

        "I developed a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the category of delay of a flight based on features like depature time hour, day of week, and distance. The model classifies delays into three categories: No Delay (10 minutes or less), Moderate Delay (10 to 30 minutes), and Lengthy Delay (more than 30 minutes). Our baseline accuracy was 42%, we were able to achieve a test accuracy of 46%. The most interesting thing about these results is the extent to which the scheduled departure time of the passenger plays into the algorithm's prediction. The next step here would be another iteration of this process, perhaps after some more feature engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of samples supporting the No Delay category were signifcantly less than the samples for the other classes, so the natural inclination is to suspect feature imbalance. Given the size of the dataset and the time consumed in training and predicting the Decision Tree Classifier for what ultimately seems to be minimal gains in overall accuracy, it may be worth trying other algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "After examining the top 10 important features we found that the most influencial factor was departure time hour followed by flight distance. This tells us that overwhelmingly, the greatest indicator of a consumer's wait time is the time that they are scheduled to leave the airport. This aligns with the exploratory analysis that indicated certain times of day are significantly more delay-prone than others, but all times of day can generally expect a delay of some sort. This, in fact, is likely why the \"No delay\" category has such a low recall and f-1 score -- there are simply fewer instances of having no wait at airports, regardless of carrier or airport. Ultimately, we did not make significant enough improvements over the baseline to consider this model reliable."
